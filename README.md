# Facial-Expression-Recognition
# Facial Expression Recognition üé≠  

This project detects facial expressions using a deep learning model trained on image datasets. It supports real-time emotion detection via webcam.

## Features
‚úÖ Detects emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.  
‚úÖ Uses CNN for feature extraction  
‚úÖ Supports real-time webcam inference  
‚úÖ Can be deployed as an API
